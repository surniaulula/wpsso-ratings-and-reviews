Ratings and Reviews for WordPress Comments with Schema Aggregate Rating and Schema Review Markup.

== Description ==

<p><img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-ratings-and-reviews/assets/icon-256x256.png"> <strong>Compatible with WooCommerce product ratings and reviews.</strong></p>

**Extends the WordPress comment system with ratings and reviews:**

* Star ratings can be enabled/disabled by post type or individual post.

* A rating value can be required (or not) before reviews are accepted.

* The review form is correctly labeled as a "Review".

* The review reply form is correctly labeled as a "Reply".

* The color of star ratings can be customized from the settings page.

**Provides [Schema Aggregate Rating](https://schema.org/aggregateRating) meta tags and optional JSON-LD markup:**

Google reads aggregate rating meta tags, or the optional Schema JSON-LD markup, to add star ratings to search results (the WPSSO Schema JSON-LD Markup add-on is required for JSON-LD markup).

**Includes complete [Schema Review](https://schema.org/Review) in the optional JSON-LD markup:**

Including information about the review (author name, creation time, excerpt, rating), along with the threaded replies / comments for each review (the [WPSSO JSON Premium add-on](https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/) is required for the optional JSON-LD markup).

<h3>No templates to modify or update!</h3>

Simply activate / deactivate the plugin to enable / disable the addition of ratings and reviews.
