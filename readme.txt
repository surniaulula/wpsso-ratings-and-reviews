Adds Ratings and Reviews Features to the WordPress Comments System.

== Description ==

<!-- about -->

**Extends the WordPress comments system:**

Adds ratings and reviews features to Posts, Pages, and custom post types by extending the WordPress comments system.

**Compatible with WooCommerce and its product ratings:**

WooCommerce provides its own product ratings and reviews features.

The WPSSO Ratings and Reviews add-on can provide ratings and reviews features for other post types, without interfering with WooCommerce's product ratings and reviews features.

**Provides [Schema Aggregate Rating](https://schema.org/aggregateRating) and [Schema Review](https://schema.org/Review) markup:**

In Posts, Pages, and custom post types where ratings and reviews have been enabled, the WPSSO Ratings and Reviews add-on includes information in the Schema markup about the review (author name, creation time, excerpt, rating) and the threaded replies / comments for each review.

**No templates to modify or update:**

The WPSSO Ratings and Reviews add-on automatically and dynamically extends the WordPress comments system without modifying any templates.

Simply activate the plugin to enable the addition of ratings and reviews.
